This is my Summerproject 2023
It demonstrates the tiling of the plane with the newly discovered Spectre Monotile.
This tile has the fascinating property that it fills the plane with a never repeating pattern.

I used python with the libraries Manim and NumPy.

I created a [pdf report](https://github.com/27amsterdam/Spectre/releases/download/v1.0.0/Bericht.Spectre.pdf) using LaTeX. For editing, I used VSCode with the LaTeX Workshop extention.

Here's the result:
